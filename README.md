## Project Exam 1

## Description

The task was to make a blog site. I created a blog site about boats.
I spent most of the allocated time on coding. The design part of the process was the second 
most time consuming part.
I found this exam task very fun and engaging. However, I find the study content and the way 
the study is set up a bit lacking. So, I had to turn to YouTube/internet more than not to find 
answers to my more complex questions, like I have had to do throughout this study. 
Then again this made the project more advanced than I had initially imagined, which in turn 
made it more fun.
All photos used on the site are my own photos, which is a decision I made early in the 
process, to avoid copyright infringement or any other problems related to that
